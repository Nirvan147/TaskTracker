# TaskTracker


# A web application made by me during my summer internship at Cisco as a Software developer intern.

It helps users to track their updates and tasks. their managers can also see these tasks on a weekly basis.
managers can see all employees under him, and suggest them what to do if found any employee not working upto the mark.
feedbacks can also be positive, managers see a weekly report of employees. they can also toggle to next week/previous week to see all detailed things their 
employees worked upon

## I used node js handlebars to run the backend. SQL database has been used to store employee information and manager's information
